This Project is done with Support Vector Machine on (Hand Written Digits Recognition) .

__________________________________________________________________

** ABOUT DATASET **

- This is mini digit recognition dataset which have 1797 images with shape 8 by 8 from numbers 0 to 9.


** ABOUT MODEL **

- I used machine learning SVM approach for this problem as it is so powerful model and can handle large datasets with high accuracy.

- The model is trained and tested on seperate sets and has the ability to predict the hand written digit from 0 upto 9 with over 99% accuracy.

- Make sure you have installed all the essentail libraries which is imported in project so you can run the program smoothly. (Sklearn, Numpy, Matplotlib)
